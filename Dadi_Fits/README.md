# Fitting a demographic model and DFE to simulated data

Inference of demography was performed using dadi:
*  [RN Gutenkunst, RD Hernandez, SH Williamson, CD Bustamante "Inferring the joint demographic history of multiple populations from multidimensional SNP data" PLoS Genetics 5:e1000695 (2009).](https://dadi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Installation was performed according to the documentation.

Inference of DFE was performed using fitdadi:
* [BY Kim, CD Huber, KE Lohmueller "Inference of the Distribution of Selection Coefficients for New Nonsynonymous Mutations Using Large Samples" Genetics 206:345 (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/206/1/345/6064197)

Installation performed according to the [documentation](https://github.com/LohmuellerLab/fitdadi). In order to run, the following scripts expect the script _Selection.py_ to be located in the same folder.
